## Low-level F# bindings for wgpu-native

*Buyer beware, these binding require heavy use of native pointers and marshaling*

This library is a set of generated WGPU.Native bindings for F#.

No shortcuts taken here- code is custom-generated based on a handwritten header parser, all developed in F#.

Documentation is a work in progress, and many aspects of the generation process and logic could use heavy refactoring, so contributions are welcome!

*wgpu-fs, a safe wrapper for WGPU.FSharp.Native which aims to bring wgpu-rs semantics to F#, is currently in development.*
